        <p>Top-level drummers know that technique and skill are essential to master the kit. That is why the Music Education Centre looks for drum teachers that can get students to have fun and play the songs they love whilst also introducing technical work, reading and transcription.</p>
        <p>Teachers working with the Music Education Centre don't have to do it alone. When you join our team, you will work alongside other professional drum teachers who have been giving lessons for many years and are happy to share their experience and knowledge with their colleagues.</p>
        <p>Annual teacher training workshops, with hands-on sessions, allow drummers to refine their skills and show why playing the drums is a great activity for students of all ages.</p>
        <p>Music Education Centre drum lessons get students to play the music they like from the radio. In recent years, the center has worked closely with the internationally acclaimed Rockschool examinations to supplement our instruction with the additional benefits of a structured and recognized curriculum.</p>
        <p>Suppose you can read drum scores and are an advanced-level drummer. In that case, the Music Education Centre can help you get started in a part-time role, with the possibility of building up so that in the future, you may be able to consider a full-time career on the drums!</p>

            <p>The guitar is the perfect instrument to share music with others, and the Music Education Centre offers an excellent opportunity for you to take your skills as a musician and help students explore this most versatile of instruments.</p>
            <p>Students of all ages, particularly those in primary school, love discovering the joy of music-making. Teachers with the Music Education Centre can concentrate on delivering lessons while the center takes care of most of the administration, billing, and, most importantly, finding the students. Teachers need to be able to turn their hand to various skills, from chords to reading musical scores and tab.</p>
            <p>Working alongside other professional guitarists allows you to share resources and teach ideas, so you don't have to constantly think about what to teach next. Annual teacher training workshops also help you discover some of the countless resources, books, and materials available, including guidance on preparing students for performance and, in some cases, even exams.</p>
            <p>If you love playing the guitar, can read music, and want to make extra income in a part-time role, with the possibility of perhaps becoming a full-time guitar teacher, then this could be your dream job!</p>

                <p>It is gratifying to see children loving their music lessons, having fun, and starting a lifetime of musical enjoyment. One of the biggest challenges for piano teachers is knowing how to keep little ones engaged, learning, and progressing in a course that provides a comprehensive music education.</p>
                <p>The Music Education Centre is proud to offer an innovative and unique teaching approach using the "Forte School of Music" courses. These courses give you a proven curriculum, with course books, lesson plans, and additional professional development and support to make you a leading educator for younger students.</p>
                <p>These lessons are perfect for new and experienced piano teachers because most of the lesson preparation is done. This structure is ideal for those who want a head start in finding out what works for kids.</p>
                <p>Small group tuition gives young students many real-life advantages over the more traditional one-on-one lessons we are used to with older children. Forte's tried and tested whole-body learning techniques make the lessons fun and interactive. In addition, having students learn to make music with others helps develop aural and social skills. Combined with traditional theory in a fun and innovative way sets students up with a solid broad musical foundation.</p>
                <p>Teachers working with us in providing these group classes for under-7's become a part of the international network of teachers from as far away as the UK through to Australia. All delivering music in this most wholistic way.</p>
